          <div class="divider white spaced"></div>
          Marshall Hall, built in 1864 and expanded in 1963, is the only remaining building on campus from the early history of Edgewood College. The property was owned by Samuel Marshall, one of the original founders of M&amp;I bank, eventually sold to Wisconsin Governor Cadwallader C. Washburn, and then finally donated to the Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters in 1881 who began the transition of the property into what it is today.
